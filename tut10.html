    <h2>this is for IDS and CLASSES in HTML</h2>
    <div id="mainBox" class="redBg">
        this is main box
    </div>
    id is like name two can not have same ids. 
    <br>
    id is given to uniquely identify
    <br>
    id is mainly used in css
    <br>
    <br>
    but same is not the case with classes
    <br>
    many div can have same classes
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    hence id is unque but classes are not unque.
    <br>
    . is for class eg:- span.redBg 
    <br>
    # is for id eg :- div#name 
    <br>
    emmet tag takes div as default eg:- .bg makes a div 
    <br>
    <br>
    to create multiple elements div#id*3 
    <div id="id"></div>
    <div id="id"></div>
    <div id="id"></div>
    <div id="id"></div>
